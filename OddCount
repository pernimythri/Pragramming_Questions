To find odd count , first need to know "How many numbers between given numbers"

It means "Ending Number - before starting number",

Ending number refers total numbers from 1 to N
Ending-(Starting -1) = Ending - Starting + 1

Odd number occurs when Even number occurs and vice versa , and those are alternative (Divide by 2)

If starting and ending both are odd ,odd count is one more than even count

If starting and ending both are even,then even count is one more than odd

If starting odd and ending even or vice versa,then odd count == even count


class Solution{
    int oddCount(int left,int right)
    {
        int TotalNumbers=right-left+1;
        int count=0;
        if(left%2==1 && right%2==1)
        {
            count=(TotalNumbers/2)+1;
            return count;
        }
        else
        {
            count=(TotalNumbers/2);
            return count;
        }
    }
}
